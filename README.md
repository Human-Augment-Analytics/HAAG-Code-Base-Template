# HAAG-Code-Base-Template

The code base requirements are the following:

A personal folders section that is designed solely for grading purposes. Currently, copy or link to your code in the separate repository https://github.com/Human-Augment-Analytics/CS-8903-Weekly-Code-Submissions.

Each project needs to have its own repo that is (1) public and (2) part of this organization.

Code contributions need to be tracked for publication attributions. Currently, each project should have a single repo. This means that the insights tab of each project repo can be used for attribution.

Code needs to be marked as either: in-progress, tested and documented, or abandoned. Currently, code can be marked in each section or in each file, it just has to be clearly marked. Code marked as tested and documented should be tested by someone other than the person who wrote it. Suggestions for the best way to do this would be appreciated.
